# Induction-program2025
Activity report of induction program 2025
<br>
Day 1 (30 July 2025)
<br>
The very first day of college felt less like an entry into academics and more like a soulful initiation into a community rooted in faith, values, and excellence.
<br>
Our day began in the serene and spiritual environment of the college Gurdwara Sahib. As bhajans like "Dhan Dhan Guru Anant Sahib Ji" and "Guru Ramdas Rakho Sharnayi" echoed through the space, there was a sense of collective calm. But it was "ਤੂੰ ਮਾਤ-ਪਿਤਾ ਹਮ ਬਾਲਕ ਤੇਰੇ" that truly touched my heart a hymn that gave me literal goosebumps and reminded me that I'm never alone in this journey. After the recitation of "Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh", we received Kadah prasad, filling our hearts with warmth and devotion. Post this spiritual beginning, we headed to Hostel No. 2. where we were offered refreshments. It was also our first casual walk around the gndec. The main highlight of the day was the session held in the college auditorium, where a series of insightful speeches laid the foundation of what gndec truly stands for. One of the speakers shared the history of gndec, how people of Gill Pind donated land, driven by a collective dream to create an institution that would empower future generations. It was inspiring to know that our college was built by the people, for the people. A senior professor delivered a speech that felt like a wake-up call. He emphasized how college is a sacred place - a space that deserves respect, sincerity, and discipline. Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal lit up the entire auditorium with her dynamic and motivating words. She beautifully stressed the need to:
<br>
•Stay away from negativity
<br>
•Embrace spirituality as a guiding light
<br>
•Build a mindset grounded in self-discipline and resilience
<br>
Her speech felt more like a conversation with our hearts than a formal address. Our respected Principal, Dr. Sehijpal Singh, spoke next and reinforced the idea that whatever branch we've received, we must respect it. He encouraged us to fall in love with our field, stay focused, and maintain a positive attitude- a theme that echoed throughout the day. The chief guest, a political figure and lawyer, S. Maheshinder Singh Grewal spoke from both legacy and experience. He proudly shared that his grandfather had a big role to build gndec and that one of his relatives is now an engineer at Boeing, having studied here. After the speeches, we had almost a one-hour break, a moment to breathe, meet fellow students, and reflect. It was during this time that I learned about NCC (National Cadet Corps), and instantly felt drawn to it. I silently made a wish to be a part of NCC someday and wear that uniform with pride. Post-break, we returned to the auditorium where students were divided department-wise, and group leaders were assigned. Our group was then guided through the ECE department, where we got our first glimpse of labs, classrooms. This wasn't just an orientation - it was a spiritual and intellectual awakening. From bhajans in the morning to the wisdom of experienced educators, every moment felt intentional, impactful, and deeply rooted in values. I now understand that gndec isn't just a college - it's a community of purpose, passion, and people who care. May this day remain the compass of my entire engineering journey.
